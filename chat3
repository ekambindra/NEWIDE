# chat3 - Atlas Meridian Continuity Log

Last updated: 2026-02-25
Project: Atlas Meridian (enterprise AI IDE)

## Session Scope

Deployment and testing hardening continuation after `chat2`, focused on CI automation and GA operational readiness evidence.

## Completed Changes

1. Added signed-release preflight secret validation:
   - `scripts/check-release-signing-secrets.sh`
   - npm scripts: `release:preflight:macos`, `release:preflight:windows`
   - wired into `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` before release packaging.
2. Added heavy validation CI workflow:
   - `.github/workflows/heavy-test.yml`
   - supports manual dispatch + nightly schedule + artifact upload retention.
3. Added benchmark publication automation:
   - script: `scripts/publish-benchmark-artifacts.mjs`
   - workflow: `.github/workflows/benchmark-publish.yml`
   - auto-updates `public-docs/benchmark-artifacts/latest-run.txt`
   - auto-updates `public-docs/benchmarks.html` latest run + KPI snapshot sections.
4. Published fresh benchmark artifacts locally:
   - `public-docs/benchmark-artifacts/ga-20260225T183545Z-seed1337/`
   - `public-docs/benchmark-artifacts/latest-run.txt` now points to that run.
5. Added deployment/testing governance docs:
   - `docs/governance/DEPLOY_AND_TEST_RUNBOOK.md`
   - `docs/governance/GA_SIGNOFF_REFRESH_2026-02-25.md`
   - updated references in `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/governance/RELEASE_PIPELINE.md`, `docs/governance/PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_AND_RELEASE.md`, and `docs/governance/GA_SIGNOFF_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification Status

1. `npm run build --workspace @ide/benchmark` - pass
2. `npm run benchmark:publish` - pass (`ga-20260225T183545Z-seed1337`)
3. `npm run release:preflight:macos` (with simulated env values) - pass
4. `npm run release:preflight:windows` (with simulated env values) - pass
5. `npm run lint` - pass
6. `npm run test` - pass
7. `npm run build` - pass
8. `./scripts/heavy-test.sh` - pass
9. Heavy test report:
   - `atlas-build-lab/reports/heavy-20260225133702.json`

## Progress Snapshot

1. Baseline platform features remain `170/170` (100%).
2. Deploy/testing hardening tasks targeted this session: `4/4` completed (100%):
   - release preflight gate,
   - heavy-test CI workflow,
   - benchmark publish workflow + docs update,
   - GA evidence refresh docs.

## Next Implementation Tasks

1. Configure GitHub repository secrets/variables and run `desktop-release.yml` with `channel=stable`.
2. Run `benchmark-publish.yml` in GitHub Actions and verify automated commit/update on `main`.
3. Confirm `docs-site.yml` serves refreshed benchmark transparency content.
4. Stamp release tag and update GA signoff record with live workflow run links.
