# chat4 - Atlas Meridian Continuity Log

Last updated: 2026-02-25
Project: Atlas Meridian (enterprise AI IDE)

## Session Scope

Completion of remaining deploy/testing work, including workflow hardening, CI failure remediation, benchmark publication, signed stable release validation, and release tag stamping.

## Completed Changes

1. Added/validated deployment workflows and automation:
   - `.github/workflows/heavy-test.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/benchmark-publish.yml`
   - hardened `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`
2. Added release preflight secret gate script and made it cross-platform:
   - `scripts/check-release-signing-secrets.sh`
   - supports env alias resolution (`CSC_*`, `WIN_*`, `WINDOWS_*`, `MACOS_*`)
   - macOS notarization credentials now optional with explicit warning.
3. Added benchmark publication automation script:
   - `scripts/publish-benchmark-artifacts.mjs`
   - updates `public-docs/benchmark-artifacts/latest-run.txt`
   - updates marked sections in `public-docs/benchmarks.html`.
4. Fixed CI deterministic dependency ordering failures by enforcing shared/package dependency builds before workspace lint/test/build:
   - root `package.json` scripts (`build:deps`, ordered `build`, `test`, `lint`).
5. Fixed heavy-test portability bug:
   - removed hardcoded local absolute path in `scripts/heavy-test.sh`
   - dynamic import now resolves from runtime workspace root.
6. Added deploy/release governance documentation updates:
   - `docs/governance/DEPLOY_AND_TEST_RUNBOOK.md`
   - `docs/governance/GA_SIGNOFF_REFRESH_2026-02-25.md` (updated with final run IDs)
   - `docs/governance/GA_SIGNOFF_RECORD_2026-02-25_v0.1.1.md`
   - `docs/governance/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.1.1.md`
   - `docs/INDEX.md` links updated.
7. Published benchmark artifacts (workflow and docs):
   - latest run id: `ga-20260225T185928Z-seed1337`.
8. Stamped and pushed release tag:
   - `v0.1.1` (points to commit `e51066cbf8c72a9b606a513df20fa9e20282164a`).

## Key Run Evidence (GitHub Actions)

### Stable validation set (commit `e51066c...`)

1. `ci` success: run `22411721453`
2. `desktop-build` success: run `22411721451`
3. `benchmark-gate` success: run `22411721456`
4. `docs-site` success: run `22411721445`
5. `desktop-release` success (`workflow_dispatch`, channel=stable): run `22412163336`

### Heavy and benchmark publish validation

1. `heavy-test` success: run `22411266585`
2. `benchmark-publish` success: run `22411405089`

### Tag validation

1. `desktop-release` success (`push` from tag `v0.1.1`): run `22413281525`

## Verification Status (Local)

1. `npm run lint` - pass
2. `npm run test` - pass
3. `npm run build` - pass
4. `./scripts/heavy-test.sh` - pass
5. `npm run benchmark:publish` - pass
6. `npm run release:preflight:macos` - pass
7. `npm run release:preflight:windows` - pass

## Progress Snapshot

1. Baseline feature tracker remains `170/170` (100%).
2. Deploy/testing completion for this session: `6/6` (100%):
   - CI failure remediation
   - heavy-test workflow stabilization
   - benchmark publication workflow run
   - stable desktop release success
   - GA signoff evidence refresh
   - release tag stamping

## Next Implementation Tasks

1. Optional: enforce notarization-required mode for GA if Apple credentials are mandatory in your release policy.
2. Optional: run `benchmark-publish.yml` on a recurring cadence and keep docs artifact history pruned.
3. Optional: add automated release-note/changelog generation step tied to tag pushes.
