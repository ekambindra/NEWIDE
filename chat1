# chat1 - Atlas Meridian Continuity Log

Last updated: 2026-02-18
Project: Atlas Meridian (enterprise AI IDE)

## Locked Decisions
1. Templates first: Node microservices + Postgres.
2. Backend: Node.js + TypeScript.
3. MVP platforms: macOS + Windows GA.
4. Product model: Open-core.
5. Deployment: AWS managed cloud control plane + local/offline support.
6. Policy default: Balanced.
7. License: Apache-2.0 (core).
8. Telemetry: opt-in by default.

## Major Completed Work So Far
1. Core desktop Electron shell with Kiro-style pane layout.
2. Workspace tree/search, editor tabs, terminal, test/log views.
3. Diff approval with chunk-level accept/reject and patch queue.
4. Diff checkpoints, checkpoint revert, signed patch manifest verification.
5. Deterministic runtime checkpoint artifacts and replay-oriented files.
6. Controlled terminal execution with policy gates and structured test parsing.
7. Pipeline runner (lint/typecheck/test/build) with checkpoint artifacts.
8. Multi-agent concurrent runtime orchestration and coordinator summaries.
9. Immutable local audit event chain and export.
10. Team layer: memory KB, ADR logs, reviewer mode, ownership mapping/conflicts.
11. Changelog/release-note draft generation.
12. Indexer improvements: parser pipeline fallback diagnostics panel, repo map, context builder.
13. Autonomy quality checks: artifact completeness and green pipeline guarantee.
14. Product rename completed to Atlas Meridian across app/docs/package metadata.

## Additional Update In This Session
1. Added grounding-evidence generation for diff applies (IDX-011 path):
   - indexer helper `buildGroundingEvidence(...)` computes line-level grounded evidence.
   - diff checkpoint flow now stores grounding evidence artifact and evidence count.
   - UI now displays grounding evidence count per diff checkpoint.
2. Added chat continuity protocol files so new sessions can continue with full context.
3. Added index freshness target gate computation and diagnostics/audit exposure (IDX-007).
4. Added module summary generation in index pipeline and diagnostics UI (IDX-009).
5. Added retrieval priority scoring with query + token budget context selection in index diagnostics (IDX-012).
6. Added index call graph extraction with caller/callee ranking and edge previews in diagnostics (IDX-005).
7. Added cross-file rename impact analysis with declaration/reference/collision metrics and affected line previews (IDX-014).
8. Added deterministic auto-repair strategies and bounded repair trace artifacts in runtime (`repair_trace.json`) (AUTO-017).
9. Added PR package artifact generation (`pr_package.json`, `pr_package.md`) including evidence/risk/rollback/owners (AUTO-018).

## Current Progress Snapshot
- Feature tracker currently records: 126/170 (74.1%).
- In-progress areas include advanced indexing, autonomy builder extensions, enterprise SSO/RBAC/security layers, release hardening, and full benchmark KPIs.

## Continuation Rules
1. Any new chat session must read this file first.
2. If context fills again, create `chat2`, then `chat3`, etc.
3. Each new chat file must include:
   - What was completed in that session,
   - Updated completion counts and percent,
   - Next concrete implementation tasks.
4. Never continue implementation before reading latest `chatN` continuity file.

## Immediate Next Tasks
1. Continue next in-progress autonomy builder features: AUTO-002, AUTO-004, AUTO-005, AUTO-006, AUTO-007.
2. Continue enterprise/public release pipeline milestones.
3. Keep extending benchmark/KPI gates and regression-blocking CI behavior.
