# chat2 - Atlas Meridian Continuity Log

Last updated: 2026-02-24
Project: Atlas Meridian (enterprise AI IDE)

## Session Coverage

This file captures non-redundant updates after `chat1`, including:

1. UI/branding stabilization,
2. build-lab generation workflows,
3. full and heavy validation infrastructure,
4. defect fixes found during validation,
5. beginner usage documentation and cross-chat handoff artifacts.

## Completed Changes (Post-chat1)

1. Codex-style UI simplification in renderer with top-toolbar feature toggles.
2. Electron runtime app naming set to `Atlas`.
3. Build-lab structure created:
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/atlas-build-lab/test-cases/`
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/atlas-build-lab/games/`
4. Sample products generated and validated in build-lab.
5. Game sample `atlas-number-duel` created with deterministic simulation mode.
6. Full test matrix document added:
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/docs/governance/FULL_TEST_CASE_MATRIX.md`
7. Full validation harness added:
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/scripts/full-validation.sh`
8. Heavy stress harness added:
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/scripts/heavy-test.sh`
9. Beginner end-user website creation guide added:
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/docs/guides/BEGINNER_WEBSITE_GUIDE.md`
10. Cross-chat AI handoff ledger added:
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/docs/governance/AI_CROSS_CHAT_HANDOFF.md`

## Defects Found and Fixed in This Session

1. Generated templates had zero starter tests.
- Fixed in `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/apps/desktop/src/main/project-builder.ts`.

2. Generated API/worker tests could hang (runtime side-effects on import).
- Fixed via direct-execution guards and explicit start functions in generated entrypoints.

3. Benchmark trend analyzer misclassified lower-is-better metric improvements as regressions.
- Fixed in `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/packages/benchmark/src/index.ts` + tests.

4. Heavy-test determinism hashing failed under locale mismatch with `shasum`.
- Fixed by switching to Node crypto hashing in `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/scripts/heavy-test.sh`.

5. Docs index had stale test matrix path.
- Fixed in `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/docs/INDEX.md`.

## Verification Status

1. `npm run lint` - pass
2. `npm run test` - pass
3. `npm run build` - pass
4. `./scripts/full-validation.sh` - pass
5. `./scripts/heavy-test.sh` - pass
6. Heavy test report:
   - `/Users/ekambindra/NEWIDE/atlas-build-lab/reports/heavy-20260223234618.json`

## Progress Snapshot

1. Baseline feature tracker remains `170/170` (100% implemented).
2. Hardening/testing/documentation tasks completed this session: `10/10` (100%).

## Next Implementation Tasks

1. Configure CI release signing/notarization secrets and run signed stable release.
2. Publish fresh benchmark artifact set and update public benchmark transparency page.
3. Add CI job for heavy-test (manual dispatch/nightly) with artifact retention of reports.
4. Finalize GA operational signoff evidence refresh using latest validation outputs.
